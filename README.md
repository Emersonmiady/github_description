*Data Scientist*

I've studied Statistics and Machine Learning since 2020 and I've worked as a Data Scientist since 2021. My experience was working in relevant companies in Brazil, such as Cielo.

I have mastery of all stages of developing a business solution using the concepts and tools of Data Science, from understanding the business to publishing the model in production using clouds.

I have already developed solutions for important business problems such as:
  - In my work: building propensity models for term products and price elasticity
  - In my portfolio: building forecast sales, vehicle insurance propensity from health insurance cross-sell and propensity of UCI bed need in covid outbreaks (2020-2021) models

The details of each solution are described bellow.

**Analytical tools:**
- Data Collect and Storage: SQL, MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server
- Data Processing: R, Python, Excel
- Development: Git
- Data Visualization: Power BI
- Machine Learning Modeling: Classification, Regression, Clustering, Time Series

## ![Health Insurance Cross-Sell](https://github.com/Emersonmiady/health-insurance-cross-sell)

## ![Rossmann Store Sales](https://github.com/Emersonmiady/data-science-em-producao/tree/main)
The Rossmann company's CFO held a meeting with all store managers and asked each of them to bring a daily forecast for the next 6 weeks of sales. In this project, I built a model to predict the daily sales and the results were good,I've obtained a **MAPE of 9.53%**! The performance of this model would bring **a revenue of predictions R$283,861,052.14** in test dataset. The worst scenario was R$283,124,045.50 and the best was R$284,598,058.79.

## ![UCI Bed Need (PT-BR)](https://github.com/Emersonmiady/previsao-leitos-uti-otimizada)
The COVID-19 pandemic reached the entire world, thus overloading health systems, which were unprepared for such an intense and time-consuming request for ICU beds, professionals, personal protective equipment and health resources. My objective was to build a model to reduce deaths due to lack of equipment, increasing efficiency in the distribution of ICU beds. I've obtained a model with a **f1-score of 0.79** in this project!
