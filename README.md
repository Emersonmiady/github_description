*Data Scientist*

I've studied Statistics and Machine Learning since 2020 and I've worked as a Data Scientist since 2021. My experience was working in relevant companies in Brazil, such as Cielo.

I have mastery of all stages of developing a business solution using the concepts and tools of Data Science, from understanding the business to publishing the model in production using clouds.
